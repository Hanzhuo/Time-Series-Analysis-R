Time series analysis is an interesting method to predict based on time series data. I provide my R code for time series analysis.

There is a easy-reading book **Forecasting: principles and practice** [here](https://www.otexts.org/fpp), which also explains time series analysis very well. The book is posted online by authors. I really appreciate that the authors Dr.Rob J Hyndman and Dr.George Athana­sopou­los can share their book for free! The R package used in my example R code is also from this book.
